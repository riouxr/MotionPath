# MotionPath
This addon allows you to generate motion path for bones, empties, vertices and objects.

Once installed, the addon will appear in the viewport's animation tab.

It will generate the path on the entire timeline uless you turn off the Timeline check box. Then you can decide your own start and end frame.

You can change to radius of the dots. You can also change the color per path.

Simple select the bone, empty, vertex or object then press on the corresponding button to generate the path. Reset will delete them all.
